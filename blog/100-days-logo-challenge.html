        Hi guys, I'm back. <br><br>
        
        Took some time off from designing. I was exploring more coding and defocused from the design world But now, 
        I’m diving back into it with the 100-day logo design challenge. I will be posting one logo per day for 100 days.
        <br><br>
        
        You can view all of my logos on this page, they will be also posted in the IG story and the best logo of the week will be 
        posted on the IG Feed.
        All of the logos I will do will be from a logo design contest website.
        <br><br>

        That does not mean if I post something today it was made today, because for some contests I have to wait for the contest to end.
        <br><br>

        This challenge isn't just about creating one logo per day for 100 days. It's about attracting clients, refreshing my design
         skills, and being more consistent.  If you're feeling motivated, you can take this challenge with me, or you can wait for 
         my final result to reveal if this challenge helped me to do more sells and get more clients, anyway I hope you will enjoy my designs.
        <br><br>
        
        Respectfully 
        Niko

                I thought forcing 100 days challenge I do crappy designs but the first one 
                turn out to be pretty good. The client requested an ancient design. The initials
                 on the logo are "TA". Hope you Will like it.</p>
