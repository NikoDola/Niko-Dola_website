        Hey everyone, I’m back! Took some time off from designing to learn new skills and get a fresh perspective. But now, I’m diving back into it with the 100 days logo design challenge.<br>

        This challenge isn't just about creating one logo per day for 100 days. It's about attracting clients, refreshing my design skills, and being more consistent. Consistency has been my weak point, and it's been affecting my client base.
        
        No matter how good and creative you are, or how many followers you have on Instagram, trust me, that’s not what matters most. What truly matters is consistency. You've probably heard this a lot, and is very true.
        
        If you're feeling motivated, let's embark on this journey together and create beautiful art every day.

        This challenge is all about real projects. Most of the logos you'll see come from design contests I'm entering. 
        Every single day, a new logo will be featured.<br>

        At the end of each week, we’ll vote for the best logo on my Instagram page. Let's pick the standout design together!<br>

        Back in 2012, I was earning quite a bit by participating in logo design contests. For this challenge, I'll be working on 99designs.<br>
        
        Some designs will have a price tag. If I didn't win that contest, those logos are free for use. Let's get creative and make some impressive logos together!
