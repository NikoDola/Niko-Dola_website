        Hey everyone, I’m back! <br>
        Took some time off from designing. 
        I was Exploarig more into coding and defocused from the design world 
        But now, I’m diving back into it with the 100 days logo design challenge.
        I will be positing one logo per day for 100 days.<br>
        <br>
        You can view all of my logos on this page, they will be also posted in IG stroy.<br>
        The best logo of the week will be posted on the Feed.<br>
        All of the logo I will do will be from a logo design contest website.<br>
        <br><br>
        This challenge isn't just about creating one logo per day for 100 days. It's about attracting clients, refreshing my design skills, and being more consistent.
